## Reading 

There are no textbooks. Required readings are mostly in the form of seminal 
[research papers](/cs6501-serverless-ai-fall25/schedule/) on serverless computing and 
AI systems. Occasionally they come from online documentations. 

There are several books that *might* be useful:

* [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/), 
by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, Aug, 2018 v 1.00
(**free book**).

* [Distributed Systems 3rd edition
(2017)](https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/ds3/),
by Maarten van Steen and Andrew S. Tenenbaum (**free book**).


## Review

Students are required to review assigned readings thoroughly. These
reading materials will be presented and discussed in class. 

This class uses the following review protocol:

* **Reading:** During each class, we will discuss two papers. You 
should read these two papers before the class, making sure to
understand the key ideas, designs, findings, and conclusions. 

* **Survey:** Fill out the survey for the papers of that class. 
The survey needs to be submitted before the class. You are allowed 
to miss at most **5** surveys without receiving penalty.

* **Note for Scriber:** Sign up as a paper scriber to capture the discussions
of a paper. You should sign up as scriber for at least 3 paper
presentations.

* **Note for Presentor:** If you are presenting this paper in the
class, you **don’t** need to submit the review for this class (this
is not counted as missing reviews). 

* **AI-tool policy for paper surveys:** While we acknowledge the 
convenience of AI writing assistants like ChatGPT in the academic
domain, it is crucial for students to cultivate their critical
thinking and writing skills. The response to survey questions should
reflect your own experience and insight into the content. Students
may use AI tools for brainstorming initial ideas or checking grammar
errors, but the surveys submitted **must** be authored by the
student. Students are expected to elaborate their survey responses in
the class.


## Presentation

Each student will be assigned multiple research papers (based on
class size) to present during the semester. 

* **Preparation:** Prepare a 25-30 minutes presentation on the paper,
summarizing the research problem, methods, results, and implications.
Please send the slides to the instructor at least 3 days before the
presentation.

* **Discussion:** Be prepared to answer questions and lead a discussion
about the paper after your presentation. 


## Class Participation

* **Attendance:** Regular attendance is expected and will be taken into
consideration when grading class participation.

* **Engagement:** You are expected to actively participate in class
discussions by asking questions, sharing your thoughts, responding
to your classmates’ ideas, and contributing to an inclusive and
respectful classroom environment.

* **Peer feedback:** Provide constructive feedback during your peers’
presentations and contribute to post-presentation discussions.


## Late policy

Late policy applies differently to review submissions and project submissions.

* **For survey submissions:** We **do not** accept late 
submissions as you already get 5 wild cards.

* **For project submissions:** Your work is late if it is not turned in by the deadline.

  - **10% will be deducted for late submissions each day after the due date**.
That is, if an assignment is late, we’ll grade it and scale the score by 0.9 if it is up to one day late, by 0.8 if it is up to two days late, and by 0.7 if it is up to three days late.
  - **Late submissions will only be accepted for 3 days after the due
date.** Assignments submitted more than 3 days late will receive
a zero. If you’re worried about being busy around the time of a HW
submission, please plan ahead and get started early.
  - **Assignment that does not compile or run will receive at most 50% credit.**

> **IMPORTANT:** Debugging
distributed systems can be time-consuming, even with AI's help.  You
need experience to harness AI to make things right.  So, please plan
ahead and get started early! 

**For fairness to all, there are no exceptions to the above rules.**


## Grading

Your grade will be calculated as follows:

* Reviews: 10%
* Class participation: 10%
* Presentation: 30%
* Project: 50%


## Academic Integrity

The School relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. We
firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle
that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate
those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can destroy
an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a
manner consistent with the principles of honor will benefit every
member of the community both while enrolled in the School of Data
Science and in the future.  Students are expected to be familiar with
the [university honor code](https://honor.virginia.edu/), including
the section on [academic fraud](https://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud).



## Students with disabilities or learning needs

It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible
as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format,
materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me
outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with
disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access
Center to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this
course, including official accommodations. Please visit 
[their website](https://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu)
for information on this process and to apply for services online. If
you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC,
please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can
develop an implementation plan together.
