# Project Overview

As a core component of this course, each student is required to
complete a course project. The project offers students the
opportunity to delve deeper into a specific topic related to
serverless computing and AI systems, addressing a practical pain
point in real world.

We will provide necessary resources, including LLM/API credit and
cloud infrastructure. More details will be shared soon...


# Requirements

* **Team:** Form a team of two members to start the project. Contact
the instructor if you need help in finding your teammates.

* **Topics:** You are highly suggested to choose a topic from the instructor's
project idea list. We prepared a list of big topics where each big topic is 
divided into multiple smaller, palatable projects that are self-contained while
correlated with each other. 

* **Proposal report:** Submit a brief project proposal outlining
your chosen topic, your research questions, and a preliminary outline
of your design. The proposal should be 1-2 pages long.

* **Checkpoint report:** Submit a short checkpoint report describing
what you have accomplished (implementation progress, challenges encountered,
preliminary testing/validation results). The checkpoint report should be 2-3
pages long. 

* **Final report:** Write a report summarizing your findings. The
report should include an introduction to your topic, a summary of
your design, implementation, evaluation, and findings, and a
conclusion discussing the implications of your work for serverless
AI. There is no strict requirement on report length.

* **Project presentation:** Prepare a 10-15 minute (tentative, and will 
be determined by class size) presentation to share your findings with
the class. You should aim to make your presentation accessible to all
students, regardless of their familiarity with your specific topic.
You are highly encouraged to include a live (or video-recorded) demo
in your final presentation. 


# Assessment Criteria

Your project will be assessed based on the following criteria:

* **Depth of understanding:** Does your project demonstrate a
thorough understanding of your chosen topic?
* **Quality of deliverables:** 
  - **A demonstrable MVP**: How complete, robust, practical, and efficient
is your system?
  - **A complete report:** Is your report well-structured, clearly written, 
and properly referenced?
  - **Presentation & demo:** Can you effectively communicate and
pitch your idea and product to the class? Is the presentation
engaging and the demo compelling? 


# Project Milestones

* **Week 2:** Team signup
* **Week 4:** Proposal report submission
* **Week 9:** Checkpoint report submission
* **Week 15-16:** Project presentation and report submission
